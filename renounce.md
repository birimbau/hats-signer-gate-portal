<!-- ## Renouncing Hats

The wearer of a hat can "take off" their hat via Hats.renounceHat.
This burns the token and revokes any associated authorities and responsibilities from the now-former wearer, but does not put the wearer in bad standing.

## How do I renounce a Hat?

1. **Sign in with the correct wallet.**
   The address you sign in with must be a wearer of the hat you intend to renounce.

2. **Visit the Hats Protocol App:** https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/

3. **Select the hat you wish to Renounce**
   You will now see a Hat's tree at a url like: `https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/...`

4. **Click Renounce in the corresponding kebab-menu**
   In the right side panel, you will see a heading named "Hat Wearers". Click the kebab-menu (the "more" button). Click renounce.

**Note:** You will only see the option to renounce your Hats, you will not see renounce as an option for other wearers of the same Hat.

**What's next? **
Remove Signing Authority via the HSG Portal. This maintenance step can be performed by any wallet to sync the multisig safe.  -->
